Authorizit is a simple and flexible resource focused authorization library. In other words it is about resources and possible actions to perform over them (based or not in additional conditions).
A simple and usefull example would be a user that can edit(action) a post(resource) if(condition) it is his post.

It was hardly inspired on [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/) a RubyOnRails gem.
